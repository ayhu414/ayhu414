### Hey There! Allen Here 👋
---

I'm Allen, a behavioral economist-in-training turned data enthusiast, aspiring full-stack data scientist (wish me luck..!) and a masters student at Columbia Engineering and Business Schools 👑! 

I primarily code in Python and R, and am currently learning the fundamentals of the data engineering stack such as 🎐Airflow, ❄️Snowflake, as well as getting re-acquainted with the fundamentals of machine learning👓. I would love the opportunity to share my progress and what I find useful in my learning process, so I invite everyone to come along my journey via my [personal page](https://www.google.com/search?q=404+costume+meme&rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1019US1019&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjv6ef3lpb7AhWPhYkEHYUzCacQ_AUoAXoECAIQAw&biw=1536&bih=760&dpr=1.25#imgrc=EwMWg0cHz8-MSM) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayhu414/)! (and of course, I love feedback and any help along the way 🙌)

Couple things I currently enjoy doing and find very rewarding:

- 🎲 Applying probabilistic thinking *everywhere*...
- 🏃 Working with behavioral data to understand human behavior
- 🏗️ Applying what I learned in class directly to my projects
- 📖 Learning deep learning concepts visually [with Yann LeCun's Course](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=yann+lecun+deep+learning+course)
- 🎨 Making Pixel Art! (Coming Soon...)
